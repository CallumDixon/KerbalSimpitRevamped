**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]
What is the issue that you are facing, that you would like resolved?
How would it benefit players?
Is it an existing/new feature in the game that would benefit from support by this mod?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
How would it be best that the feature is implemented? What sort of data may need to be sent by the mod to controllers? Would it require a digital signal, or an analogue one?
Would it need a terminal command to help use it, or a GUI button?

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.
What about the current features of the program do not quite, if at all, allow you to implement/carry out what you would like to do? What is the nearest feature in the mod (If there is one), that is along the lines of what you are suggesting?

Any drawings, screenshots, pseudocode/logic diagrams, and more are all appreciated. Anything that you feel may help others understand your idea would be great!
