What feature are you trying to use that is in the documentation, that is not behaving as the documentation says it should/will do?
What have you done to ensure the issue is a bug? Have you tried checking different combinations of button presses for example, to ensure that it is indeed not your controllers code?
How repeatable is it? Eg "After I press stage 100 times, the mod will not take any more inputs from my controller"

**To Reproduce**
